# SearchEngineCompare
Initial commit of a Selenium based search engine comparison tool. Takes in a search topic and compares top results across Google, Bing, and duckduckgo.
Brings up a console which asks for your desired searh topic and searches that topic across 3 searh engines. Next commit will compare results across the 3 engines.
